# Eyes

# Description

This project made use of both styling and Javascript.  We created a set of eyes that follow the mouse around the page by using the style property ball and then we obtained co-ordinates to calculate the boundaries of the window which resulted in the ball moving with the mouse.

# How to Run 

Move the mouse around the page to see result.

# Roadmap of future improvements
