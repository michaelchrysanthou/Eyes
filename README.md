# Eyes

## Description

This project made use of both styling and Javascript.  We created a set of eyes that follow the mouse around the page by using the style property ball and then we obtained co-ordinates to calculate the boundaries of the window which resulted in the ball moving with the mouse.

## How to Run 

Move the mouse around the page to see result.

## Roadmap 

Add more Styling

Add more interactive elements
